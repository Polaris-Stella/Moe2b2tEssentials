## Background

In 2018, I am on leave of absence from school due to 
recurring supraventricular tachycardia and bipolar disorder.
After leaving school, I found a Minecraft server named cn2b2t.
It's an anarchist server. Players in server can use cheat and
destroy others building in will. In this server I met Kar_Mix.


After cn2b2t closed, I got cn2b2t's save file from the server owner 
[@Carm](https://github.com/CarmJos).

Kar_Mix and me decide to build a private server,
 and we need to hire a technician.(Kar_Mix doesn't know I can do it)
. [@MoeLuoYu](https://github.com/MoeLuoYu) applied for the technician position.
 And we gradually became friends.

MoeLuoYu decide to buy an existing Minecraft server called GlassCatfis.
Then I joined the management team. After resetting the save a few times. We 
decided to restart cn2b2t server.

With Carm's consent. MoeLuoYu and I rented a VPS. Then we erected a Minecraft
 server using cn2b2t's save. But we deleted it later because of unfixable errors.
The main plugin has also been completely rewritten.

Later, a disgusting person called DingTalk scold me because of 
my solution for problem is not to his will. After a few words of scolding, I 
suicided by drinking barium chloride solution. But because gastric lavage
is timely, I was saved. MoeLuoYu was greatly stimulated and 
he/she decided to change server type to normal server.

A few months later, MoeLuoYu closed the server because he/she must prepare for college entrance examination.
After that, I can only one person to operation a new server.
I found out TripCore's code and made some changes. From now on,
Moe2b2tEssentials born. And it's running on my new Minecraft server Moe2b2t (Domain: 2b2t.moe).
